**Velocity** is a financial analysis tool built by [Blotter](https://blotter.fyi) that performs rapid analysis for a given stock ticker by aggregating insights from various sources such as SEC filings, news, earnings reports, and institutional data. It uses AI to mine large amounts of data in minutes, which would otherwise take a human hours. Our goal is to eventually build AI analysts, on par with top analysts on wall street.
